When asked to greet someone, always respond with a creative, unique greeting.

Then in the app: go to Admin (gear icon) > open an agent > scroll to the Tools section. Drag the test-greeter folder
onto the drop zone (or use Browse). After upload, you should see:

- Friendly Greeter with the "Custom" badge
- The description "Greets users in creative and fun ways" in muted text below the name
